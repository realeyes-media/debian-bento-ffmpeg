[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/realeyes/debian-bento-ffmpeg/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/realeyes/debian-bento-ffmpeg)

A squeaky-clean base image for projects requiring FFMPEG and Bento4 installed and in the PATH. Based on https://github.com/bitnami/minideb image for the smallest possible image size without hacking MuslC and GlibC into an Alpine container.
